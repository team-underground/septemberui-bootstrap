		<hr>
		<p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.</p>

		<p>Elements of good typography:</p>

		<ul class="list-unstyled">
			<li>
				<strong>Consistency</strong> - makes the work look professional and keeps your readers focused on the content and not the formatting.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Hierarchy</strong> - it is important that your text gets read in the order that itâ€™s meant to be read in.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Alignment</strong> - helps keep the look of a piece of content unified
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			For any projects or web based applications please use the font family
			<a
